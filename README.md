# 2023 Advent of Code

This repository will have my code for the 2023 Advent of Code found [here.](https://adventofcode.com/)

This will be my first time doing the Advent of Code and I will use this as an opportunity to learn the Go programming language as I have only written a few simple Go programs. Each solution is located in a different folder based on the day. As I am using this as a learning process there may be some unique items to Go sprinkled in. I am curious about go routines, so there will be some use of them in at least a few of the days.
